### React Bored Tasks Web App.

- - - - 

The "Bored Tasks" project is a web application built using the React.js framework and powered by the BoredAPI. This application aims to help people find fun and engaging activities to do when they are bored.

Upon opening the application, the user is presented with a simple user interface that displays a random activity of any random category. 

Each activity is displayed on a separate coloured card and provides the user with a link to the most relevent resource to complete the task or atleast learn something about it and number of participants requireed to do it.

Overall, the Bored Tasks project aims to provide an easy-to-use, interactive platform for people who are bored and looking for something fun and engaging to do. By leveraging the power of the BoredAPI and the React.js framework, this application offers a vast array of activities for users to choose from, making it an ideal platform for individuals of all ages and interests.

The project is work in progress. Code and link will be added as soon as it is ready for use!
